    <td colspan="34">Consumers    in respect of whom a prescribed activity is undertaken can create Victorian    energy efficiency certificates (VEECs) under the Victorian    Energy Efficiency Target Act 2007. One VEEC    represents one tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-e) to be reduced by the    prescribed activity undertaken by the consumer. Consumers are able to assign    their right to create VEECs to an accredited person (Like Auspro Group). In    assigning their right to Auspro Group, they will be entitled to create and own    the certificates in respect of the prescribed activity undertaken by    consumer. In return, the Auspro Group provides consumers with an identifiable    benefit for the assignation, such as a price reduction on a product, free    installation or a cash-back arrangement. Consumers should be aware that it is    their responsibility to negotiate satisfactory terms with the accredited    person in return for assigning their right to create VEECs.
